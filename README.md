Oh, boy, have I got a treat for you! Introducing the latest and greatest in code obfuscation technology! Now you can make your code completely unintelligible to anyone who dares to try and read it! And the best part? Your code will still run perfectly fine even after it's been encrypted, just to really confuse the heck out of anyone who tries to make sense of it!

But wait, it gets even better! With this package, you can encrypt not just one, but MULTIPLE directories of code! That's right, you can make entire swaths of your project unreadable, just to ensure that no one will ever be able to understand what you were thinking when you wrote it.

So, if you're looking to make your life easier by making everyone else's harder, look no further than our encryption package! Guaranteed to make your code as incomprehensible as possible, or your money back! (Just kidding, we're not actually giving refunds. Good luck figuring out how to use it!)

## Usage

The package is in it's final development stages.

## Supported Languages

The package currently only works on Golang code, but fear not my dear developer, we have big plans for the future. We'll be scaling to more languages soon!

## Dev Note

And isn't this what programming is all about? Making things needlessly complicated for no reason?
